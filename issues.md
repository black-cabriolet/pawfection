# Pawfection Project Issues

Based on my examination of the codebase, I've identified the following issues that need fixing:

## Critical Issues
1. Incomplete Code in page.tsx: The main page.tsx file is incomplete and ends abruptly at line 91 with an incomplete section tag '<section id="pricing'. This will cause the application to fail to compile.
2. Missing Components in page.tsx: While there are imports for Pricing, Contact, and Blog components, the corresponding sections for these components are missing or incomplete in the JSX return statement.

## Code Style Issues
3. Inconsistent Quote Usage: Some files use single quotes while others use double quotes for imports and JSX attributes.
4. Inconsistent Semicolon Usage: Some files have semicolons after export statements while others don't.
5. Inconsistent Class Naming: The Blog component uses camelCase for CSS classes ('blogGrid', 'blogCard') while other components use kebab-case.
6. Inconsistent className Application: In the Footer component, className is inconsistently applied with curly braces in some places but not in others.

## Development Notes in Production Code
7. Comment in ReactParticles Component: There's a comment at the top of the particles.tsx file that appears to be a development note.
8. Comment in Navbar Component: There's a comment about image location that should be removed.
9. Comments in Footer Component: There are multiple development comments that should be removed.
10. Comment in SmoothScroll Import: There's a comment '// âœ… add this' in the layout.tsx file.

## Performance and Best Practices Issues
11. Console.log in Production Code: There's a console.log statement in the ReactParticles component that should be removed.
12. Missing TypeScript Type: The particlesLoaded function in ReactParticles has a parameter without a TypeScript type annotation.
13. HTML img Tag Instead of Next.js Image: The AboutUs component uses the HTML img tag instead of Next.js's Image component.
14. Empty Configuration File: The next.config.ts file is essentially empty with just a comment placeholder.
15. Inconsistent Image Formats: The Gallery component uses a mix of .jpeg and .png file extensions.

Would you like me to fix these issues? If so, which ones would you like me to address?
